### A visual playground for exploring Large Language Models

LLMagic is a collection of small, visual, data-driven experiments that explore the internal behavior, structure, and variability of large language models (LLMs).  
Each mini-project aims to reveal *how* models think, respond, and drift â€” through interactive plots, embeddings, and statistical analysis.
